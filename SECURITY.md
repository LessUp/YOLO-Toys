# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

- Prefer opening a private GitHub Security Advisory.
- If that is not possible, please contact the maintainers via private channel.
- Provide as much detail as possible (version, PoC, impact, mitigation ideas).

We aim to respond within a reasonable timeframe.
